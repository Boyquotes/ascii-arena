# ascii-arena

This was made as part of a self-imposed 3 day game jam in which I was the only participant. I got second place but the game is "finished!" There are a good deal of issues with it and some additional gameplay features I'd like to implement, but the goal was to get a minimum viable game out in 3 days, not to make something pretty. If I do come back to work on this again, it will probably be well in the future.

# Gameplay

* WASD to move
* k to restart game

* Left mouse button to fire
* LifeTime (represented by the red bar) depletes over time and when hit by enemies. Let it drop to zero and you die.
* LifeTime increases on kills earned (as does score)
